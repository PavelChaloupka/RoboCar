RoboCar project is to create a small smart car controled by wirelles. Inspiration are mars vehicles by NASA.

This project is based on the Arduino platform and its aim is to encourage more people to develop the device. The goal is to use only commercially available components and show what one can build.

Gradually will be edited description and instructions for development.

At this time it is controlled via the RC, and the driver reacts to the distance of obstacles ahead of the vehicle. .

The project consists of a chassis, Arduino Nano, RC transmitters / receivers, managing H bridge motor control and ultrasonic sensors,

In the future, the car had to be more clever and manage simple tasks itself and should be controlled via wifi. The plan is such that it will generate the web page. through which the car will be controlled. This will on the one hand, ensure easy connection and on the other hand, the management multiplatfom. In the future it is planned to have a camera and solar panels, and more.
